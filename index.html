    <H1>History of memes</H1>
    <p>An Internet meme, or simply meme, is a cultural item (such as an idea, behaviour, or style) that is spread via the Internet, often through social media platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc. Internet memes can take various forms, such as images, videos, GIFs, and various other viral sensations. Characteristics of memes include their susceptibility to parody, their use of intertextuality, their propagation in a viral pattern, and their evolution over time. The name is from the concept of memes proposed by Richard Dawkins in 1972.</p>
